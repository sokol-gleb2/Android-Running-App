Hello!

This is my first app for Android (coded in Android Studio), made for runners. 

This app asks you different questions about your preferred distances, PBs, goals, locations, future races for running and saves it all in a file. It then proceeds to give the user suggested workouts to reach their goals. As with any running app, when one starts their workout, a map shows up and tracks their location live, and highlights the route as they are running. At the end of the workout, the distances and times are displayed and are also saved to a file - to be later accessed in the "History" tab.

If you are interested in the full review of my code, please read "GSokolovskyi Computer Science Project" and watch the screen recording of the apps.
